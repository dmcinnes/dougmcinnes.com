<h1>GTA Style Zombie Survival in a Randomly Generated World</h1>
I'm pleased to announce the release of my new game Dead Valley.

<a title="Dead Valley" href="http://www.deadvalleygame.com">Play it!</a>

It currently does not work on mobile devices, but that's coming soon!

Here's a video showing gameplay:

I'll eventually write a post on the basics of how it works but for you buzzword compliant people here's some of the HTML5 technologies I used: Web Audio, Canvas, Gradients, CSS 3D Transforms, Local Storage, Multiple CSS Backgrounds, CSS Opacity, and Web Workers.

Enjoy!
