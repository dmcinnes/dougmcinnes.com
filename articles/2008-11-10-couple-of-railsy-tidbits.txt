I made a post on the <a href="http://geminstallthat.wordpress.com/">Gem Install That</a> blog detailing the <a href="http://geminstallthat.wordpress.com/2008/11/07/simple_admin-met-a-pieman/">simple_admin plugin</a> which adds a simple authentication scheme to your Ruby on Rails application.Â  It stores usernames and passwords in a <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a> file to make it extra easy.

<a href="http://geminstallthat.wordpress.com/author/reidmix/">Reid</a> also posted on Gem Install That about another plugin we worked on, <a href="http://geminstallthat.wordpress.com/2008/11/01/subselector-moneypenny/">Subselector</a>, which extends ActiveRecord to give it subselection capibilities.
