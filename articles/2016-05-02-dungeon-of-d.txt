title: Dungeon of D
date: 02/05/2016

As a recent side project I've built an [HTML5 version of Dungeon of D](http://dod.dogwatchgames.com/), a single player card game.

[Original Print & Play Game](http://www.jackdgames.com/free_games#mf_itemGuid.557a5ef00a7d22.3884731) by [Jack Darwid](http://www.jackdgames.com/).
([Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34639/dungeon-d))

<strong>[Play It!](http://dod.dogwatchgames.com/)</strong>

This will work on at least the iPad/iPhone and (up to date) desktop browsers. If you have an Android device please let me know if this works!

[Source is also available](https://github.com/dmcinnes/DoD) for the curious.

If you run into any bugs [please let me know](https://github.com/dmcinnes/DoD/issues)!
