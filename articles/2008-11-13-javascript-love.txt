I've been a busy bee releasing stuff into the wild lately.  Most of them have been Ruby on Rails plugins but I've also been doing some Javascript work.  Here's two tidbits that I developed at the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/">Los Angeles Times</a>.
<h4>Inplace_preview</h4>
<a href="http://github.com/latimes/inplace_preview/tree/master">Inplace_preview</a> is the first.  It monkeypatches <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">Scriptaculous</a>' <a href="http://github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous/wikis/ajax-inplaceeditor">InPlaceEditor</a> to give it a preview mode.  It also includes an ability to do an ajax call for rendering the preview.  It comes in handy when using an InPlaceEditor for editing HTML but with the ajax rendering anything would be possible.

<h4>Gallery_scroller</h4>
<a href="http://github.com/latimes/gallery_scroller/tree/master">Gallery_scroller</a> is small Javascript library for creating a scrolling gallery that we're using on more projects then I expected.  It requires <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a> and <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">Scriptaculous</a> <a href="http://github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous/wikis/effects">effects.js</a> libraries.
